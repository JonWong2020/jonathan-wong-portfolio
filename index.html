      <p>Hello, my name is Jonathan Wong and
        I am currently a devloper in training.  I was born and raised in 
        Los Angeles where I initially worked as an opthlamic technician.  
        Due to the coronavirus pandemic, I began to weigh the prospects of 
        changing my career path because of the various stay at home mandates
        and social distancing.  Below you will find various projects that I have
        worked on as well as various means of contacing me.  Thank you for your time
        to look over my page.
